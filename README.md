<a id="installation"></a>
## Installation

### Install with Homebrew Cask

```bash
brew install --cask ping-island
```

### Download a Release

1. Visit the [official website](https://erha19.github.io/ping-island/) for the product overview and latest download link, or go straight to [Releases](https://github.com/erha19/ping-island/releases).
2. Download the latest DMG.
3. Move `Ping Island.app` into your Applications folder.
4. Launch the app and start the clients you want Ping Island to monitor.

> On first launch, macOS may ask you to confirm the app or grant Accessibility / Apple Events permissions for focus features.

<a id="build-from-source"></a>
### Build from Source

Requires macOS 14+ and an Xcode toolchain that can build the Xcode project and the Swift 6.1 `Prototype` package tests.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erha19/ping-island.git
cd ping-island

# Debug build
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland -configuration Debug build

# Release build
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland -configuration Release build
```

To create a locally shareable unsigned package for local testing:

```bash
./scripts/package-unsigned.sh
```

The script re-signs the built app bundle with a consistent ad-hoc signature before creating the `.dmg` and `.zip`, which helps embedded frameworks launch more reliably on another machine. The package is still unsigned for distribution and not notarized, so first launch may still require `Open` from Finder's context menu or manual quarantine removal.
The generated files land in `releases/unsigned/` as `PingIsland-<version>.dmg` and `PingIsland-<version>.zip`.
The DMG uses the repo-tracked installer artwork at `docs/images/ping-island-dmg-installer-background.png` by default; set `PING_ISLAND_DMG_BACKGROUND_SOURCE` if you want to preview a different background locally.

To create signed and notarized release packages in GitHub Actions, configure the release secrets described in [docs/sparkle-release.md](docs/sparkle-release.md) and run `.github/workflows/release-packages.yml` against a `v*` tag or the manual workflow dispatch input. Official Homebrew Cask release notes are documented in [docs/homebrew-cask-release.md](docs/homebrew-cask-release.md).

The same workflow also publishes a Linux `PingIslandBridge` asset that Ping Island can download when bootstrapping Linux SSH hosts.

For the full notarized release flow and the GitHub Releases backed Sparkle appcast setup, see [docs/sparkle-release.md](docs/sparkle-release.md).

## What is Ping Island?

Ping Island is a macOS menu bar app that expands into a compact session surface when your coding agents need attention. It listens to Claude-style hooks, Codex hooks, Gemini CLI hooks, Antigravity CLI plugin hooks, Hermes Agent plugin hooks, Pi Agent extension hooks, Qwen Code hooks, Kimi CLI hooks, OpenClaw internal hooks plus session transcripts, the Codex app-server, OpenCode plugins, and compatible IDE integrations so approvals, input requests, completions, and session summaries show up without babysitting terminal tabs.

If you have seen [Vibe Island](https://vibeisland.app/), Ping Island is positioned as an independent open-source alternative in the same category: a native macOS notch/menu bar surface for monitoring and controlling AI coding sessions.

## Features

Ping Island focuses on the moments that actually interrupt coding flow, then keeps them visible and actionable from a native macOS notch surface.

- **Attention-first UI** - Stay compact until a session needs approval, input, review, or intervention.
- **Act from the notch** - Approve tools, deny requests, and answer follow-up prompts without hunting through tabs.
- **Claude Code auto-approve** - Turn on per-session auto-approval when you want Claude Code to stop pausing on every permission request.
- **AI approval policies** - Connect an OpenAI-compatible model to review responsive Hook approvals, auto-handle low-risk or all decisions, and keep a redacted 30-day local audit trail.
- **One-click return** - Jump back to the right iTerm2, Ghostty, Terminal.app, tmux pane, or IDE window.
- **SSH terminal support** - Bootstrap a remote PingIslandBridge over SSH, rewrite remote hooks to point back at your Mac, forward remote Codex app-server activity, and keep remote terminal activity visible in the same local Island UI.
- **Multi-agent coverage** - Track Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, Antigravity CLI, Hermes Agent, Pi Agent, Qwen Code, Kimi CLI, OpenClaw, OpenCode, Cursor, Qoder, Qoder CN, CodeBuddy, WorkBuddy, GitHub Copilot, and other compatible sessions in one place.
- **OpenClaw gateway support** - Follow OpenClaw sessions from managed internal hooks, then refill the conversation from OpenClaw's local session transcripts so the Island UI can show the actual back-and-forth instead of a single inbound message.
- **Codex hook + app-server sync** - Support Codex CLI hooks, live app-server threads, and rollout parsing fallback when needed.
- **Custom sounds** - Pick per-event macOS sounds or import local sound packs for your own notification style.
- **Custom agent mascots** - Give each client its own animated mascot override across the notch, session list, and hover UI.
- **Buddy detach in v0.5.0+** - Drag the active Buddy out of the notch so it can stay nearby as an independent floating companion.
- **Hermes courier-fox mascot** - Hermes Agent uses a gold courier fox with a winged helmet and satchel so plugin-hook sessions stay visually distinct from the Claude/Qwen family.
- **Pi terminal-cloud mascot** - Pi Agent uses its own terminal-cloud mascot so extension-hook sessions are easy to spot in the Island UI.
- **Qwen capybara mascot** - Qwen Code now ships with a mint-scarf capybara mascot tuned for prompt, reply, and notification-heavy flows.
- **Kimi keyboard-orb mascot** - Kimi CLI keeps its original blue keyboard-orb mascot so its hook sessions stay visually distinct in the README strip and app UI.

## Testing

The fastest full-repo regression path is:

```bash
./scripts/test.sh
```

That covers:

```bash
swift test --package-path Prototype
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland -configuration Debug CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test -only-testing:PingIslandTests
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland -configuration Debug CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- test
```

Useful targeted slices:

```bash
swift test --package-path Prototype --filter IslandBridgeE2ETests
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland -configuration Debug CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO test -only-testing:PingIslandTests
xcodebuild -project PingIsland.xcodeproj -scheme PingIsland -configuration Debug CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY=- test -only-testing:PingIslandUITests
```

If `PingIslandUITests-Runner` stays suspended on macOS, run the UI tests from Xcode with a valid local signing identity and check `amfid` / `AppleSystemPolicy` logs before treating it as an app regression.

## Settings

The **AI Approvals** category configures the OpenAI-compatible endpoint, model, Keychain-backed API key, decision rules, automation mode, connection test, and local audit history. The feature is off by default; see [AI approval configuration](docs/ai-approval.md) for behavior and privacy boundaries.

## Custom Sounds

Ping Island currently supports three sound modes under `Settings -> Sound`:

- **System sounds** - choose a macOS sound for each event.
- **Built-in 8-bit** - use Island's bundled retro sound set, including the fixed client startup sound.
- **Sound pack** - load a local OpenPeon / CESP-compatible pack from disk.

### Quick setup

1. Open `Settings -> Sound`.
2. Turn on `Enable sounds`.
3. Pick the mode you want:
   - `System sounds` if you just want a different macOS sound per event.
   - `Sound pack` if you want fully custom audio files.
4. Preview each event with the play button and leave only the event toggles you want enabled.

### Import a local sound pack

1. Switch `Sound mode` to `Sound pack`.
2. Click `Import local sound pack`.
3. Choose a folder that contains `openpeon.json`.
4. Pick the imported pack from the `Sound pack` dropdown.

Ping Island also auto-discovers packs placed under `~/.openpeon/packs` and `~/.claude/hooks/peon-ping/packs`.

### Minimal sound pack layout

```text
my-pack/
  openpeon.json
  session-start.wav
  attention.ogg
  complete.mp3
  error.wav
  limit.wav
```

```json
{
  "cesp_version": "1.0",
  "name": "my-pack",
  "display_name": "My Pack",
  "categories": {
    "task.acknowledge": {
      "sounds": [{ "file": "session-start.wav", "label": "Session Start" }]
    },
    "input.required": {
      "sounds": [{ "file": "attention.ogg", "label": "Attention" }]
    },
    "task.complete": {
      "sounds": [{ "file": "complete.mp3", "label": "Complete" }]
    },
    "task.error": {
      "sounds": [{ "file": "error.wav", "label": "Error" }]
    },
    "resource.limit": {
      "sounds": [{ "file": "limit.wav", "label": "Limit" }]
    }
  }
}
```

### Event mapping

- `Processing started` checks `task.acknowledge`, then `session.start`.
- `Attention required` checks `input.required`.
- `Task completed` checks `task.complete`.
- `Task error` checks `task.error`.
- `Resource limit` checks `resource.limit`.

Release builds can also publish a Linux `PingIslandBridge` artifact alongside the macOS app packages, which Ping Island uses when bootstrapping remote SSH hosts that are not running macOS.

Sound packs can use `.wav`, `.mp3`, or `.ogg` files. If a selected pack does not provide a matching category for an event, Ping Island falls back to the macOS system sound selected for that event.

## How It Works

```text
Claude / Codex / Gemini CLI / Antigravity CLI / Hermes Agent / Pi Agent / Qwen Code / Kimi CLI / OpenCode / Cursor / Qoder / Qoder CN / CodeBuddy / WorkBuddy / Copilot / ...
  -> hook or app-server event
    -> Ping Island monitor + normalization layer
      -> SessionStore
        -> SessionMonitor / NotchViewModel
          -> notch, list, hover preview, completion popup
```

Implementation details worth knowing:

- Claude-family tools enter through managed hook files plus the embedded `PingIslandBridge` launcher.
- Codex sessions can come from hook events or the live `codex app-server` websocket monitor.
- Gemini CLI hooks are installed into `~/.gemini/settings.json`; tool matchers use Gemini's regex-based hook matcher syntax.
- Antigravity CLI uses a generated native plugin under `~/.gemini/antigravity-cli/plugins/ping-island/`; Ping Island returns `ask` from its observational `PreToolUse` hook so Antigravity's own permission engine remains authoritative.
- Pi Agent is wired through a generated TypeScript extension under `~/.pi/agent/extensions/ping_island/` and forwards events through the Claude-compatible bridge with Pi-specific client metadata.
- Qwen Code hooks are installed into `~/.qwen/settings.json`; the bridge follows the official event names and uses `Stop` / `SessionEnd` / `Notification` messages to surface popup-ready summaries in Island.
- Kimi CLI hooks are installed into `~/.kimi/config.toml`; Ping Island preserves unrelated TOML content and maps Kimi `Stop` to turn completion while `SessionEnd` closes the session.
- OpenCode is wired through a generated plugin file under `~/.config/opencode/plugins/` and enabled from the documented global config at `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`; legacy `config.json` entries are still recognized for cleanup.
- Remote SSH hosts can bootstrap `PingIslandBridge`, rewrite remote Claude-compatible hooks to target that bridge, and forward remote events back into the local Ping Island UI.
- Focus routing spans iTerm2, Ghostty, Terminal.app, tmux, and VS Code-compatible IDE extensions.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.0 or later
- Best experience on MacBooks with a notch, but external displays are supported too
- Install whichever CLI or desktop clients you want Ping Island to monitor
